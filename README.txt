your task is to develop a simple e-commerce website, which includes 3 main pages as following:

and implement the main required features, such as:
- search products
- add to cart
- remove from cart
- calculate checkout total price

you should use the following tech stack:
- html
- css
- js
- bootstrap

plus your knowledge about:
- git and github
- figma

use the following api to get and search products:

use localStorage to store array of IDs (IDs of products added to cart)

use sessionStorage to store search results before redirecting the user to products page, if the user tried to search products from another page, such as single product page or cart page, then remove sessionStorage immediately after displaying them

the website must be responsive

watch the following video to learn how you can handle the single product page:
